# RNN-Shakespeare-Generator

I used https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation as a resource to help me generate text using a character-based Recurrent Neural Network based on Shakespeare's writing. This project served as a resource for me to learn TensorFlow as this is my first project using TensorFlow. shakespeare.txt is the training data used to train the RNN. The reading/processing of the data and building/training/testing of the model are all done in run_shakespeare_rnn.py.
